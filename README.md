Optimization Solver
Project Overview
This project provides solutions to various Optimization Problems using Python. It focuses on maximizing or minimizing objectives like profit or cost while satisfying specific constraints. The solutions are implemented with Pythonâ€™s scipy library and are designed to run interactively in Jupyter Notebooks.

Objective
The project demonstrates how to:

Optimize an objective function, such as maximizing profit or minimizing cost.

Examples of Problems
1. Maximizing Factory Profit
2. Minimizing Manufacturing Costs
3. Maximizing Production with Limited Resources
4. Optimizing Revenue from Sales
5. Allocating Resources Between Two Projects
6. Production Planning for a Bakery
7. Reducing Costs for a Transportation Company
8. Boosting Revenue from Two Products
9. Budget Allocation for an Advertising Campaign
10. Optimizing Meal Planning for a School Cafeteria
